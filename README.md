# ark-consultancy
Ark Consultancy is a one-page responsive real estate consultancy agency website created using HTML and CSS.  

The website contains sections inluding the team members, properties on offer, a basic form for enquiries and an embedded Google Maps location for the fictional company. 

Instead of opting for Bootstrap, I decided to use flexbox to get a better understanding of how responsive layouts work.
